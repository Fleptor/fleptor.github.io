    <h2 class="secondHeading">History</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2 class="s2Heading">The Beginning</h2>
    <p>December 2019, DC activity had declined and to prevent it from falling further our friend AbuMeshal had an idea to increase chat activity by weekly giving out the ownership of the server to the most active members at the time. It's January 2020 our story starts here, where it was time for Fleptor to recieve ownership over DC, and Fleptor had an idea to do something special for his week by turning the place into a "Fleptorized" version of DC, and he'd call it "Flepness Paradise", it didn't take Fleptor long to figure out that after his ownership is done all the effort will be reset, so he had decided to turn it into an actual Discord server, and thus on the 17th of January 2020 "Flepness Paradise" was created.</p>
    <h2 class="s2Heading">The Golden Age</h2>
    <p>The server was created, members were invited and the 1st week activity started slowly, that didn't stay for too long however, because surprisingly the server's activity had increased after, and members where chatting actively on a daily basis. Two months after in March 2020 and things were going great for the server and with recent events such as the pandemic and the infamous deletion of DC had only ensured extra activity. Fights had started usually between members, but that was never the server's fault to be blamed for and for four more months things we're still going great until...</p>
    <h2 class="s2Heading">The Inevitable</h2>
    <p>Nothing lasts forever it's the norm of life, It's August 2020 and things are going downhill some members weren't chatting or appearing to say the least, Fleptor wasn't mentally feeling the best, and other members couldn't care and focused on other things. August passed and September came, the end is near us what a shame, however one member (Jad) stood up and was fed with current state of FP and decided to resurrect the activity by doing something big, something dangerous, something which Fleptor feared since the start, Jad had continued the DC discordservers series with a third installment, DC 3.0, It's late September 2020 DC 3.0 was made, members were invited, FP was abandoned "It's it, it's the end of the FP legacy" or so Fleptor thought, but what he or anyone else hadn't anticipated happening was for DC 3.0 to follow along with FP and meet its demise.</p>
    <h2 class="s2Heading">The Comeback</h2>
    <p>With a new year comes new plans and horizons, It's Jan 2021 DC is beginning to perish and follow the path of its predecessors, FP is nothing, but memories and Fleptor was introduced to Sami and with him comes an empty server he made in 2018, but didn't use until now, which he Fleptor and Lukaz used to talk and send invites while playing games like Krunker and Minecraft, more friends started joining the server and with them comes Adel and Jad, whose failed attempt at resurrecting the place made him officialy stop the DC server series, but as always he had an idea, The 1st three months of 2021 were spent hanging in Sami's gathering, and in late March 2021 Jad decided to execute mentioned idea with Fleptor which was: "Flepness Paradise 2" which Fleptor would call: "The Comeback!". Fleptor with some help of Jad started working on the place, "Technically it must surpass the previous iteration." Fleptor said, and it did with proper activity level, staff application, guilds, suggestions, and more it was going to be great, and with the announced release date of 12th April 2021 and a teaser members were excited to join and begin talking. "I'm happy the member are satisfied, but something feels 'off'" Fleptor said, and he's correct somethin was off which turned out to be the name of server "Flepness Paradise 2" never felt quite alright because then members would expect a 3rd server? and the point isn't to move on from the 1st FP, but to bring it back in a modular form, so Fleptor decided to rename the place to: "Flepness Paradise" and the previous server to: "Flepness Paradise Classic".</p>
    <h2 class="s2Heading">Not stopping</h2>
    <p>Maybe a stop here or some inactivity there, but we're still going, no more new servers no more splitting, we're still going, even if we have to stop for real life reasons we're still going, while activity had dropped off immensely since the start of the place, but that wouldn't be enough for us to stop and move on to other server which would come across the same fate anyway, we still join and talk in voice channels and hangout, and chat with other members from time to time, and who knows what the future is holding for us?</p>
